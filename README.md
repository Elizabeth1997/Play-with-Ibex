I only have a portable laptop ðŸ’» 
Whenever I need to train models using GPU to accelerate, I cannot count on my own laptop. Thankfully KAUST provides abundant GPUs resources for students.
Therefore, I start my journey of making friends with Ibex.

Let's play with Ibex together!
A. Use Jupyter notebook remotely, so you can run jupyter files from ibex remote server on yous local browser!
B. Use Pycharm installed on your localhost already to run the files on the remote server with GPU!

Actually, A and B can be regarded as simliar ways you could play with ibex happily.

I'm a serious person so I would like to introduce B first.

### Pycharm connects remote server
1. download professional version Pycharm
2. create a project which you wants to run on the remote server (e.g. Test)
3. configure remote server's ip address
